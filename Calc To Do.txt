Extra Credit
Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)


Add keyboard support! You might run into an issue where keys such as (/) might cause you some trouble. Read the MDN documentation for event.preventDefault to help solve this problem.


-MAJOR CODE CLEAN UP
-REFACTORIZATION?


DONE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

FIX wrong behaviour:

10 x 10 = 100

5 / 5 = = = [1; 0,2; 0,04; 0,008]

12 + 7 - 5 * 3 =


BLOCK: 

9 / = 1
9 x = 81
9 - = 0
