Extra Credit
Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)
Make it look nice! This is a great project to practice your CSS skills. At least make the operations a different color from the keypad buttons.
Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
Add keyboard support! You might run into an issue where keys such as (/) might cause you some trouble. Read the MDN documentation for event.preventDefault to help solve this problem.




FIX wrong behaviour:

10 x 10 = 100

5 / 5 = = = [1; 0,2; 0,04; 0,008]

12 + 7 - 5 * 3 =


BLOCK: 

9 / = 1
9 x = 81
9 - = 0
9 + = 18

9 % %
9 x x
